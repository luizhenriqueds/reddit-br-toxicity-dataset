## **Toxic Content Detection in online social networks: a new dataset from Brazilian Reddit Communities**

This is new dataset of 2,500 manually annotated examples of comments extracted from the top 10 largest Brazilian subreddits on Reddit. The dataset has been annotated by crowd-sourcing efforts with contributions from the departments of computer science (DCC) and the linguistic group of UFMG. As part of our contribution to the toxicity automatic detection and moderation of online social networks, we're making the dataset public for research.

### Dataset

The dataset contains 2,500 manually annotated comments from the most popular brazilian communities on Reddit. The data sampling proccess was a stratified sampling the number of generated publications by subreddit and the month of publication. The list of communities collected is presented below. The collected data period ranges from January 2022 to December 2022.

### Metrics
Agreement, groups

### Usage
Toxicity classification models are very scarce for low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese. The goal of this dataset is to foster the experimentation and advancement of applied Machine Learnign techiniques in order to improve existing methods as well as propose new ones. For instance, one can train and benchmark with existing machine learning models from scratch. Also, another alternative is to fine-tune existing large language models.
